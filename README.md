# To-Do-List-Builder
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Current Issues:

-Table will word wrap if the text has spaces in between each letter, but verylongstringslikethis will extend the table and mess up formatting.

-Window resizing; table formatting looks weird when window width is smaller than 530px

-Extra styling?

Excerpt from ThatOneBrah's fb post:

Alright guys, so the competition starts tonight!

I'm sure you're all wondering what you will be assigned. And now the wait is over!
Each group will make their own To-Do List Builder App, which will utilize AngularJS and be styled to provide a good end-user experience.

Now, I was originally going to write a long list of requirements, like you would get for a school assignment, but my better judgement told me that was a bad idea. It would squander any potential group creativity and make for a very boring competition.
So instead, I wrote a very general list of requirements. Here it is:

1. Each group will create an AngularJS app (front-end only, no databases or servers) that will be used to create to-do lists
2. Each group's app should allow users to create, remove, and mark list items as complete as well as mass select and delete, and also clear completed items
3. Each app should allow users to create optional deadlines for any list item
4. Each app should allow users to create alarms based on these deadlines

And that's all for the requirements. Each group will have a lot of creative freedom for their app, which should allow for teams to create a uniquely-branded app and make the competition much more interesting.
Each group's app will be evaluated by all other dev team members based on the following:

1. Overall appearance
2. Usefulness of app and features
3. End-user experience (how easy and interactive the app is)
4. Most of all, creativity!

Okay guys, so now that you all have your assignment, get together with your partners and start drawing out those user interfaces! I expect to see some great things!

If you have any questions, post them here as a reply. Good luck!

P.S. Feel free to use any tools necessary to complete your app. *cough cough* UI Bootstrap *cough cough* Look it up *cough cough*
But seriously, don't limit yourselves! Be creative!
